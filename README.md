## Abstract:
Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) use complex decision-making (DM) models with multimodal sensory inputs, making rigorous validation and verification (V&V) essential for safety and reliability. 
These models pose challenges in diagnosing failures, tracing anomalies, and maintaining transparency, with current manual testing methods being inefficient and labor-intensive. 
This vision paper presents a methodology that integrates explainability, transparency, and interpretability into V&V processes. 
We propose refining V\&V requirements through literature reviews and stakeholder input, generating explainable test scenarios via large language models (LLMs), and enabling real-time validation in simulation environments. 
Our framework includes test oracle, explanation generation, and a test chatbot, with empirical studies planned to evaluate improvements in diagnostic efficiency and transparency. 
Our goal is to streamline V&V, reduce resources, and build user trust in autonomous technologies.
